It's an elevated ropes-obstacle course, where you're navigating through bridges, rope swings, nets, walking across rotating logs, and there was even one point where you went down a zipline, had to jump off the zipline and onto a net, and then climb up the net to get to another platform! A tonnnn of fun, especially on the more difficult trails. There are 8 different trails with 4 levels of ascending difficulty, and it's a choose-your-own adventure kind of thing - go at your own pace on whichever trails you'd like. You'll have the park all to yourselves, no other people, for 4 hours!\u00a0</div>",
